  <h3>Use of Information Collected.</h3>
  <p>
    Except as specifically outlined in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your Personally Identifiable Information or Account Information with non-affiliated third parties without your permission. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information and aggregated information (such as demographic information and certain statistical analysis) to third-party service providers or developers to ensure compliance with applicable laws, monitor for fraudulent activity, or to review or audit our Website and Services. However, before sharing your information with any third-party, we require that the third-party enter into an agreement with us that requires that third-party to keep your information confidential, and prohibits that third-party from using your information for any purpose that is not related to the Website or Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may choose to disclose information, including Personally Identifiable Information, that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Service. For example, if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one party has engaged in deceptive practices, we may choose to give that person or entity’s contact information to victims who request it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may choose to disclose information, including Personally Identifiable Information, in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we’ll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason. By creating an account to use the Services and providing an email address, users authorize Sugar Trek to provide them with important announcements, relevant promotions, and other related communications. Users will always have the opportunity to opt-out of these communications at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Except as set forth herein, Sugar Bot does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose Personally Identifiable Information collected from and about its users to third parties.

  </p>
  <h3>Payment Processing.</h3>
  <p>
    Your Account Information and Personally Identifiable Information will be transmitted to a third-party service provider for the purpose of processing any payments.

For more information on how your payment information is processed, please see the terms and conditions of our third-party service provider at https://stripe.com
  </p>
  <h3>Use of Cache Data.</h3>
  <p>
    A cache is a component of your mobile device that transparently stores data for record-keeping purposes. Cache data does not identify users, but does identify your mobile device. Most browsers and Websites are initially set up to accept such data. If you prefer, you can program your device so that it does not store this information while utilizing the Website or Services. Certain Website or Service features may only be available through the collection of such data. We may use cache data to assist in data collection and to track Website usage and trends to help us better serve you. We also permit third-parties who have entered into confidentiality agreements with us to access cache data to help us monitor use of the Website and Services for fraud or any other activity that does not comply with applicable laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of our business partners (e.g., analytical tracking software providers) use cookies and tracking technologies on the Website and Services. We have no access to or control over these cookies or tracking technologies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies and cache data on the Website and Services by us only, and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any third-party business partner.
  </p>
  <h3>Account Security.</h3>
  <p>
    The security of your account relies on your protection of your password and device. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password and device. You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. We will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an email, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the Website interface. We urge you to keep your password confidential and refrain from sharing it with others. Sugar Bot will not disclose, share, sell or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to any third-party without your prior consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sugar Bot uses coding practices that help prevent attack on our Website and Services from web browsers and malicious scripts by processing all actions through several permission verification checks. Sugar Bot also encrypts your information. You can help protect your account against unauthorized access to your Personally Identifiable Information by selecting your password appropriately and keeping it confidential. We recommend that you choose a password that is difficult for others to figure out, and that you limit access to your device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any email or other communication requesting your password or asking you to provide sensitive account information via email should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to us immediately at legal@sugarBot.com  If you do share your password or device with a third-party for any reason, the third-party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately. If you believe that an unauthorized access has already occurred, is occurring, or will occur please report it immediately at legal@sugarBot.com
  </p>
  <p>
    We may have access to your password and may use such password to access your account for debugging, quality assurance, or other internal purposes.
  </p>
  <h3>Information Storage.</h3>
  <p>
    Sugar Bot stores Aggregate Information about you in order to optimize and operate the Website and Services. Sugar Bot will not store Aggregate Information collected from the users of the Website and Services for more than five (5) years.

  <h3>Maintaining and Updating Your Account Information.</h3>

    As part of your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining and updating your Account Information with current and complete information. You may edit and delete portions of your Account Information. To do this, select “My Account” in the main menu and choose which information to edit or delete. You can also delete your Sugar Bot Account entirely. To do this, select “close account” in the profile menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    After receiving any requested changes to your Account Information or Personally Identifiable Information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all of your personal information stored in databases we actively use to operate the Services will be updated, corrected, changed, or deleted as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or change in our active databases. We may retain such information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our Terms of Service. In addition, it may not be technologically possible to remove every record of the information you have previously provided us, as a copy may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate.
    If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you have discovered that your child created an account and would like to have it deleted, please e-mail us legal@sugarBot.com with your child’s username, email address and password.

Please note that our Services are intended only for use by residents of the United States. The United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy regulations.
