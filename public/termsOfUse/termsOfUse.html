  <h3>14. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</h3>
  <p>
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Initial Dispute Resolution</h3>
  <p>
    Our Customer Support Department is available by email, at legal@sugarbot.com, to address any concerns you may have regarding the Services. Our Customer Services Department is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our players’ satisfaction. The parties agree to use their best efforts, through this customer service process, to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement. Good faith negotiations are a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Binding Arbitration</h3>
  <p>
    If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Services will be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS, formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., with the provisions of its Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the JAMS excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award will be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Sugar Bot will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Sugar Bot will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Location</h3>
  <p>
    If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents in Canada, arbitration will be initiated in the County of Clark County, State of Nevada, United States of America, and you and Sugar Bot agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Clark County, State of Nevada, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Class Action Waiver</h3>
  <p>
    The parties further agree that any arbitration will be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND SUGAR BOT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above will be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Exception for the Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</h3>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Thirty (30) Day Right to Opt-out</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: legal@sugarbot.com. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services otherwise you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Sugar Bot also will not be bound by them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sugar Bot will provide you with sixty (60) days prior notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the sixtieth (60th) day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) day.
